# old-barstoolsports
This makes it so the current barstoolsports version has the look and some functionality of the old version.
It changes the color and themes back to old versions for each city.
It also opens the comments by default and reverses the sort order of them from oldest to newest.

Directions: Use the old-barstool.js code with any browser that supports userscripts.  For firefox use greasemonkey and chrome use tampermonkey.
