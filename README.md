# old-barstoolsports
This makes it so the current barstoolsports version has the look and some functionality of the old version.
It changes the color and themes back to old versions for each city.
It also opens the comments by default.

Directions: Use the old-barstool.js code with any browser that supports userscripts.  For firefox use greasemonkey and chrome use tampermonkey.

I'll be updating this for enhancements or as barstool makes changes that negate the functionality (like the comment sort order).
